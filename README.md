## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create an easy to use, deploy, and maintain home server. In reality, I got kind of bored and wanted to create something for my own personal needs, to pull myself away from the constant upkeep of my complicated jank.

The current plan is to only support a single node. I'd like to expand it for redundancy in the future but it's outside of the scope for now. x86 and ARM64 support is going to be the priority, however depending on architecture support by the applications some packages may be unavailable on ARM.
